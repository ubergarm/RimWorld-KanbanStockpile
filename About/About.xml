    <description>RimWorld mod adding `Stack Refill Threshold` and `Similar Stack Limit` to stockpiles and deep storage inspired by kanban logistic control systems.

## Features
#### Stack Refill Threshold
* Just like "pause when satisfied" for a billâ€”but for hauling to stockpile stacks!
* Defaults to 100% which gives the same as behavior as vanilla.

*Example*: Set your RimFridge Important dining room stockpile to 20% and it won't trigger hauling jobs for any specific stack until there are less than or equal to 2 meals left in it (meal stack size is 10).

#### Similar Stack Limit
* No more than `Similar Stack Limit` stacks of a thing are allowed in the stockpile.
* Defaults to `OFF` which gives the same behavior as vanilla.

*Example*: Set your Medicine Cabinent Preferred hospital stockpile to a `Similar Stack Limit` of 1 and you will get no more than a single stack of any medicine and drug type now instead of clogging it up nothing but rotting herbal medicine and smoke leaf joints!

#### First Class Multiplayer Support
* Data stored using determenistic dictionary keys and all state mutations properly sync'd!
* All development done in a multiplayer context locally with arbiter to minimize potential desyncs.

## Full Example
Setup a raw ingredients food Preferred stockpile in the kitchen next to your stove. Set the `Stack Refill Threshold` to 0% and the `Similar Stack Limit` to 1. This way you will get a variety of fresh ingredients close to the cook and will reduce spoilage because the stack is not refilled until it has been completely used up.

## Performance
* Uses `for` loops similar to vanilla style code for basic `C#` optimization
* Skips hot code paths anytime a stockpile is set to default values
* Avoid using high values of `Similar Stack Limit` in large stockpiles as it must scan every thing in every cell
* Turn off `Reserved Similar Stockpile Limiting` in Settings if you have an older CPU or large colony with many reserved hauling jobs to scan

## Credits
Thanks to bananasss00 for contributing code from their github fork that I was unable to directly merge.

Original idea and inspiration came from my failed attempt to multiplayer patch Satisfied Storage.

Inspiration for the `Similar Stack Limit` feature came directly from the great Variety Matters Stockpile.

I got most of the GUI hooks and all the Transpiler stuff from Uuugggg's (AlexTD) Stockpile Ranking.

This mod relies heavily on Harmony for ease of patching.
